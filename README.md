My personal blog made using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/).

I made this [blog](#) specificially to explain my development workflow. 

As well as my thought progress that goes into creating a project from concept to deployment.

Forked from [Gatsby blog starter](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog) with a few tweaks.
