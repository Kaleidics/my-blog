OH MAN! I've been busy!

<br/>

Going to tons of meetups. Meeting tons of entrepreneurs trying to pitch me their ideas. Hacking out an web application MVP for the city of Sacramento!

<br/>

I'm pretty freakin tired. I even took this monday off to help Code4Sac get their Neighborhood Connect App going. That's the web application I'm talking about for the city of Sacramento.

<br/>

I'm not really feeling like I can write a coherent post right now haha... But this is what I'm talking about if you're wondering: [NeighborHood Connect](https://github.com/code4sac/neighborhood-connect)

- Worked with like a huge team of 20: frontend people, designers, backend people, database guys, devops
- It's been a long weekend and apparently this app is super important
- I had no idea going into
- Spearheaded pretty much all the design implementation from the designs mockups to the web app
- They wanted this up over two days, so my code is a mess obviously and so is this post

<br/>

But it's been 10 days gotten check in eventually right?
