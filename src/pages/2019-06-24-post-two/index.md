In case you didn't know, well how would you, I recently became a co-host for my city's freeCodeCamp meetup.
We usually get a lot of beginners and newbies that come and go. So the main host, my friend Javier, asked me
to make a small community introduction board. Basically, a sort of RSVP system, where newcomers would post
who they are and their goals with coding.

It's been a good two weeks since I worked on the backend with Node. I've been focusing heavily on SASS, and trying to figure out how to convert a .CSV file to fit in a NoSQL database for another project. So revisiting this backend stuff is actually a little bit more a challenge than I'd like to admit. Specifically, I'm stuck on this `null` duplicate error in the terminal for my register auth route. But I think I've already found the answer on this [stackoverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24430220/e11000-duplicate-key-error-index-in-mongodb-mongoose).

Anyways, I'm on the only one working on this right now. I've got tonight and Thursday to work on it. And I've got an ElectronJS meetup Tuesday and a Women in Data meetup Wednesday with some :cool: speakers :woman: (I'm not sure I'm allowed to go to that one, but I got my ticket already :question:). Finally, on Friday I've got my weekly freeCodeCamp meetup. Hopefully, I've got something to show and hopefully, no one asks me to debug their css again.

Got this one off the todo list as well today. :waning_gibbous_moon:
