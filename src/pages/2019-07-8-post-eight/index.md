So, I guess I got my first paying client even though I offered to do it for free. It's strange doing a project for someone else haha. Most of project this far have been for me only and for the most part only seen by me and possibly recruiters. It's a strange feeling going from not knowing how to do any of this to building something that someone else will use. Do they call this imposter syndrome?

<br/>

Anyways this blog is for accountability and transparency right? Well originally, the client wanted a wordpress site, which is good idea they've got a built in CMS and hosting platform all for the low price of $5? Well that and $69 for a theme. So I said, "you know what I'll do it for free, just for exposure." But he insisted on paying me. If you know me I ain't a modest guy, I'll take what I can get :sunglasses:.

<br/>

So the pay is up for debate, but not a priority for me. Getting the freakin site up is! And [it is up](https://netwrkr.netlify.com/), but I have no idea where to take the design. He's working with a designer too, but all they sent me was a logo! And, they sent me it as a PDF! I had to screenshot and take that freakin thing to Microsoft Paint to crop the logo. :expressionless:

<br/>

Anyways this was a quick mockup using GatsbyJS, a starter template, and the Netlify CMS, which is free. Takes a little more configuration on my part but beats out having to pay a perpetual $5 to Wordpress right? :moneybag:
