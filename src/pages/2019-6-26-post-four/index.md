Wow! Two meetups two nights in a row! I know right.

I want to work on some actual code before I go to sleep. And, writing markdown for this blog entry doesn't count. Let's make this quick.

<br/>

I went to the `{blog.posts[3].title}` today. That's not a typo just being cheeky since it's a long title.
Anyways, it was an amazing meetup. I never realized there was such a huge interest in data science in my city. :woman:

<br/>

I guess I just haven't been going to the right places at the right time. So, I'm adding this one to my regular weekly meetup. That makes ~~two~~ three I think. Hopefully, someone can teach me how to use [D3](https://d3js.org/). Since data science + d3 that's like <strong><em>the</em></strong> deadly duo right? I don't know. 

<br/>

Also got reacquainted with an old, well... acquaintance. His name is Walter, super smart and works for the state of California and part of Code for Sacramento/America. Planning to contribute or rebuild some of their projects. Have you seen their [WICit](https://findwic.com/#/map) app? What's going on there??? :confused:

<br/>

Not that I can complain, my projects aren't anything to write home about. But let's add a complete remake of WICit to my todo list.

<br/>

Hmmm ranted a little more than I expected. Guess, I'm motivated. :fire:
