Alright, it's almost midnight. And, here we are again.

<br/>

I went to my first [SacJs Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/The-Sacramento-Javascript-Meetup/events/262275346/) today. I was super excited to learn about ElectronJS and learning to build a desktop app with
JavaScript :grinning:

<br/>

The speaker, Toshiro made his own better, faster, stronger Turbotax clone. Super cool at first...
then he started getting into the development hurdles. Well not coding specifically, but the problems with the ecosystem surrounding
the Electron environment.

<br/>

First you gotta pay like $200 for a Organization Validated Certificate, so when someone downloads your app,
your operating system doesn't freak out and give you a warning.

<br/>

And, even if you pay it, you've gotta get a certain number of downloads from users through IE or Edge of all things before it's actually validated.

<br/>

If you thought optimizing for browser compatibility was a pain, now you've also got to do it for operating system compatibility.

<br/>

I won't lie I'm little turned off with the deployment aspect of a Electron app, but the actual technology itself is still pretty cool.
I might build something with it in the future. But not today, it's 12:14am now. :sleepy:

<br/>

Got these off the todo list today with some of that Gatsby [plugin magic](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-plugin-html-attributes/):

~~Accessibility issues and Google lighthouse audit~~

<br/>

:100: :fire: :fire: :fire: across the board.
<br/>

Still could use some performance optimizations but not a priority right now.
