So, somehow over the course of the past week, I accumulated 3? more projects to do.
At least I can't say I've got no ideas.

<br/>

1 - freeCodeCamp Elk Grove Introductions app.

<br/>

2 - Remake of my Coins Compare App using D3 for visualization (still learning that thing).

<br/>

3 - The Community Supported Agriculture Directory project with data pulled from USDA, since they don't even have their own API, gotta figure out how to convert the .CSV to an actual database.

<br/>

4 - A podcast website for a freelance client I met at the Women in Data meetup. Gotta figure out how an RSS feed/XML plays with React, hopefully someones got a npm module for that

<br/>

5 - Also got plans to remake Code for Sacramento's WICit app. It hasn't been updated in 2 years? I'll have to go to their meetup on Wednesday.

<br/>

Quite a few challenges. But, I can do it.
