Ok, didn't make as much progress as I would have liked in the past few days. But, can you blame me it's July 4th week/weekend? It's on a Thursday, kinda weird.

<br/>

But, I've got a self-imposed deadline for the freeCodeCamp Introductions app at tomorrow's meetup. [Backend](https://github.com/Kaleidics/fCC-introduction-backend), is completely setup with authentication and CRUD operations. 

<br/>

I just need to write out the [front-end](https://github.com/Kaleidics/fCC-introduction-app), which you know is actually a little bit more challenging. I spent a ton of time trying to come up with a design. 

<br/>

But, I just settled on the start-up-y, flat art hero image on the side, with a call to action. Spent a ton of time on the animations too. Probably not the best use of time, since I should get the functionality down first.

<br/>

I want to get at least the authentication down with the signup/login UI. But it isss... the 4th of July. Well, I'll spend two hours at least, that's a promise to myself.
