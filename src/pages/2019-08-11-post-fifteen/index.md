Wow it's been so long that I've written anything here. Super busy with meetups, interviews, and code challenges (not sure if that I can talk about those?).

<br/>

In any case, I am supposed to be writing about my development process for my projects. So, I've still been working on a podcast site for a client. I realized something. I was too anchored to his initial color commitments: White, Blue, Yellow. So this caused me to try to implement a design based on the colors. Which, didn't produce great results. It's so obvious, but what I should have done is implement a design and then apply the colors. Makes so much more sense.
