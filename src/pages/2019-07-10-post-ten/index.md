Today, I went to the Code4Sac meetup to learn more about the hackathon they are having on the 20th. Well, I learned it was less of a hackathon more of a "hey we need help building this app" and for free lol.

<br/>

The app in question is called Neighborhood Connect. It's supposed to be a community portal connecting local community leadership to the more centralized city government. Local neighborhood leaders will have special permissions to create topics. The topics can be anywhere from homeless encampments to street maintenance. The app is meant to track high priority and reoccuring issues in local communities and not necessarily a chat board for one-off items.

<br/>

Since most of the guys at the Code4Sac seem to be working for the state of California (seems appropriate since Sacramento is the capital), it seems they're mostly skilled in backend technologies.

<br/>

The tech-stack seems like it's going to be C# and a REST API for the backend. And, they want a React frontend. I guess that's where I come in. Hopefully some more frontend developers show up on the day of the "hackathon".

<br/>

Based on the wireframes they demo'd, functionally, it looks like a todo app that allows upvoting of a list items by authenticated users, who also are given special authorization (in this case community leaders).

<br/>

Functionally, very similar to my movie review app. But I guess I should just to make their mockup from what I saw to get a head start. They did say they wanted to build out the whole thing from scratch over a weekend...

<br/>

I also spoke to one of the contributors of the [WICit](https://findwic.com/) app. It hasn't been maintained. I checked their Google Analytics for it. Seems like they only had 33 users over 3 months. A handful of those are probably me checking it. I also found another website that essientially fulfills its purpose: [WIC Store Locator](http://www.wicstorelocator.com/). So it may not be a great use of time to recreate it. I'll put this on a lower priority and shift focus to their more recent projects like the Neighborhood Connect and CityGram(this one is also 2 years old...).
