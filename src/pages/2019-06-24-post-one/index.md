I was supposed to get started on an actual project, but instead I made a blog about making those projects. Took me a little longer than expected. Does that count as procrastination?

<br/>

This blog like all my projects are written in custom styles using SASS. 

<br/>

`<sarcasm>` I don't use CSS frameworks because I like doing things the hard way. `</sarcasm>`

<br/>

Blog is not mobile responsive yet.

Need to check if that redish pink color is AXE friendly.

Get the routing setup for blog posts that are a series.

<br/>

A ~~little~~ lotta work to do tomorrow as always and not enough time.

<br/>

And... I just noticed the linebreaks in my markdown aren't being converted in the html markup, even though my markdown preview shows it. Looks like I gotta use the `<br/>` for now.
